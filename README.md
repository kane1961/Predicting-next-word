## Data Science Capstone Project

## Preface

This is the last challenge to complete my Data Science specialization!
To get to this point, I needed to learn a completely new subject, Natural Language Processing, and it took me more than four months of studying and testing. I came back several times to test the solutions through quizzes.
Finally we have an App that is simple but running. I would like to thank my wife for all the Saturday nights that only ended with Sunday's sunrise.
